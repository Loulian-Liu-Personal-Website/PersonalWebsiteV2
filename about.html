            I like to pick up weights at least six days a week. Preferably I put
            the weights back and/or not give myself crippling injuries.
            Currently trying to reach the 1000lbs club by the end of 2023.
            Progress ain't going too well though heh.

            Building keyboards is a goal hobby of mine. Why goal? Because it's a
            super expensive hobby and one day I hope I can afford keyboards for
            all 17 sets of arms I have.

            Once upon a time, I cooked a very poor quality steak with above
            average flavor, but the pictures my girlfriend took of it were so
            good that they looked like stock photos for a steak house.
          </p>
          <p>
            Queue: me wanting to make a steak that feels and tastes as good as
            it looked in the photo.
